# 🧠 DSA Tracker

**DSA Tracker** is a full-stack web application that helps users systematically track and manage their Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problem-solving journey across multiple coding platforms.
It enables users to save links to the problems they've solved, making it easier to find and revisit those problems during revision—without having to recall which platform or topic they belonged to—all in one centralized platform for all your DSA problems.

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 **Track Solved Problems** – Log problems you've solved from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, GFG, and more.
- 🔁 **Mark for Revision** – Flag questions for future revision and keep track of revision status.
- 📝 **Add Personal Notes** – Save your own notes, tips, or custom solutions for each problem.
- 🔍 **Filter & Search** – Filter by platform, topic, difficulty, revision status, and more.
- 📊 **Progress Overview** – Visualize your progress and identify areas to improve.
- 🔐 **Authentication** – Secure login with email/password and Google Sign-In support (coming soon).
